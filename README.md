# daymap_legacy
The original shipping version of DayMap.

This repository contains the complete source files for DayMap as of version 2.1.5.

**The shipping version is found in the "DayMap V2" folder.**

At the top level of this repository is an unfinished "V3" rewrite. This rewritten version of DayMap has an updated CoreData model and data layer written in Swift. In the V3 version, there is almost no UI except for a few views for iOS.
