Here's the procedure that I use to obtain a sample receipt for debugging:
 
Create a test user in iTunes Connect (under "Manage Users")
Create a new version of the application in iTunes Connect (adding descritpion/screenshots is enough, you don't have to click "ready to upload binary")
Make sure the app version number matches exactly the one of your debug build
Do a clean build of your application in Xcode
Now launch your app in Finder (important, if you launch it from Xcode it will just die with exit code 173)
Finder notices that there's no receipt and prompts you for you iTunes username and password
Enter your test user credentials
Finder will download a valid reciept and put it inside the appliation package
App launches
 
Once that's done, open the application package in Finder and copy the "receipt" file into a folder in your project. In your debug build you can then load that receipt instead of the real one.
